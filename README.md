# Advanced Subject Teacher AI Agent
## Introduction
The Advanced Subject Teacher AI Agent is an interactive AI-powered learning assistant designed to provide clear, structured, and subject-specific explanations for student queries. It supports Math, Physics, Chemistry, and Science and delivers detailed, markdown-formatted explanations tailored to the user's question.

One of its key features is the student feedback mechanism, which allows users to submit feedback after receiving an explanation. Based on the feedback, the AI can refine and improve its response before generating the final answer.

This project utilizes LangChain, Streamlit, and Groq’s LLM to create an intelligent, structured, and engaging learning experience.
